# EE608 - Digital Image Processing


This repository provides the assignment questions and solutions to the EE608 (Digital Image Processing) course conducted by [Dr. Parimala Kancharla](https://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~parimala/) at Indian Institute of Technology Mandi (IIT Mandi)

It also consists of the Project which me and my teammate [Shilpa Chandra](https://github.com/shilpac131) did together on denoising of images.
