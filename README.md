# EE608 - Digital Image Processing


This repository provides the assignment questions and solutions to the EE608 (Digital Image Processing) course conducted by Dr. Parimala Kancharla at Indian Institute of Technology Mandi (IIT Mandi)

It also consists of the Project which me and my teammate Anika Shrivastava did together on denoising of images.
